# NeuralNetworkLibrary
This is a neural network library that can be used for any dataset.
The neural network library has already been implemented for recognizing handwritten digits.
The data for the handwritten digits is already included under train.csv and test.csv.
To implement the neural network library for another training dataset, the training TrainingData class would have to be modified.
